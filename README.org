There is a wonderful tiny [[https://github.com/joukewitteveen/xlogin/blob/master/x-daemon.in][bash script]] (thanks to Jouke Witteveen for
this beauty!) that turns X server into a daemon.  Here is how it works:
when you run this script, it starts X server and catches USR1 signal.
When this signal is received, it means X server is ready to be used by
clients, e.g. you can run a window manager on it, etc.  This SIGUSR1
behaviour is documented in =man Xserver=.

So this =Xdaemon= script can be used by such service managing programs
as [[http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/][Systemd]] or [[http://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/][Shepherd]].

This repository exists because I wanted to make a general-purpose
package that can be built using [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/The-GNU-Build-System.html#The-GNU-Build-System][The GNU Build System]].  Also I added
=Xkill= script that allows to kill an X server run on a particular
DISPLAY.

Thus you can use the following sequence of commands to build and install
this package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
autoreconf -vfi
./configure
make install
#+END_SRC

If you are not familiar with the GNU build system, here are some
comments:

- =autoreconf= is used to generate "configure" script.  This phase is
  not needed for a release that already contains "configure" and
  "Makefile.in" files (such a release is generated with "make dist"
  command).

- =configure= phase creates final files from ".in" files ("Makefile",
  "src/Xdaemon" and "src/Xkill").

- Invoking =make= (before =make install=) does nothing by itself as
  there is nothing to compile â€“ the ready-to-use scripts are generated
  during the =configure= phase.

- Finally, =make install= installs scripts to [[/usr/local/bin]] or another
  configured directory (see "./configure -h").
