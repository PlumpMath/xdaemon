      (description
       "Xdaemon is a wrapper bash script that allows to turn X server
into a daemon.  When Xdaemon is started, it runs Xorg server, then waits
until it will be ready to accept connections from clients, and quits.
Another script that comes with this package is Xkill.  It allows a user
to kill an X server running on a particular @code{DISPLAY}.")
      ;; 'Xdaemon' script is under FreeBSD, the rest is under GPL3 or later.
