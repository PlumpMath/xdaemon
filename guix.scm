  (description
   "Xdaemon is a wrapper bash script that allows to turn X server into
a daemon.  When Xdaemon is started, it runs Xorg server, then waits
until it will be ready to accept connections from clients, and quits.
Another script that comes with this package is Xkill.  It allows to kill
an X server run on a particular @code{DISPLAY}.")
  ;; 'Xdaemon' script is under FreeBSD, the rest is under GPL3 or later.
